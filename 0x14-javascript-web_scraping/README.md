# 0x14. JavaScript - Web scraping

## General
* Your code should be semistandard compliant. [Rules of Standard](https://standardjs.com/rules.html) + [semicolons on top](https://github.com/standard/semistandard). Also as reference: [AirBnB style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/node
* All your files must be executable
* You are not allowed to use var

## Install Node 10

> curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -

> sudo apt-get install -y nodejs


## Install semi-standard
[Documentation](https://github.com/standard/semistandard)

> sudo npm install semistandard --global

## Install request module and use it
[Documentation](https://github.com/standard/semistandard)

> sudo npm install request --global

> export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules

Notes: Request module has been deprecated since February 2020 - the team is considering alternative to replace this module - however, itâ€™s a really simple and powerful module for practicing web-scraping in JavaScript (and still used a lot in the industry).
