# Tasks

## [0. Get all states](./0-select_states.py)
  Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:
* Your script should take 3 arguments: [ mysql username, mysql password and database name ] (no argument validation needed)
* You must use the module [ MySQLdb (import MySQLdb) ]
* Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
* Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
* Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
* Your code should not be executed when imported

## [1. Filter states](./1-filter_states.py)
  Write a script that lists all states with a name starting with N (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:
* Your script should take 3 arguments: [ mysql username, mysql password and database name ] (no argument validation needed)
* You must use the module [ MySQLdb (import MySQLdb) ]
* Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
